### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My name is Suryansh as you might have guessed from my profile.
It basically means being a part of the sun (yeah my parents have really high ambitions for me i guess)
It's all good though, I like my name and its a bit unique
Don't ask me about the ambition part though, I'm still figuring out my own.

## Current Status
I'm currently pursuing a Bachelor's in Technology.
I major in Computer Science.

## Interests
As my bio says I like all things technology, that includes everything from fun facts and new discoveries to weirdly niche things.
I like learning and consider myself an avid learner but I also get bummed when I fail at said things (I'm only human too).
I like arts(both traditional and digital), games, movies, shows and most things one might consider entertaiment.
Oops can't forget music, that's one thing i like more than most things, who doesn't like a good jam ^_^
That's about what i can remember for now, maybe I'll update this in the future, who knows
